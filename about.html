      <p>"Nerdobirdo" is a name that I created for my art. The "Nerdo" part is how I am a nerd with certain things that I enjoy (i.e. video games, reading, anime).</p>

      <p>And the "Birdo" part is how when I was younger, I would sometimes play on my older brother's 'Gameboy Color Advance' and the only game that I played was "Super Mario Advance", which one of the bosses was named "Birdo".</p>
